                    As a Project Manager, I had the opportunity to work closely with and assist multiple students under the Build Club for two and a half semesters. In this role, I conducted several workshops to teach them about cutting-edge technologies, such as STM32 Boards. My objective was to foster innovation and generate new product ideas among the students, with the potential to make a significant impact in the outer market, potentially leading to the formation of a startup company. 
Throughout this process, our Build Club was affiliated with the IIT Madras Incubation Cell, which provided valuable support and resources to nurture and develop these ideas into tangible projects.
